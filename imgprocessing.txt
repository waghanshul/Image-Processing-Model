Steps to Create an Image Processing Model
Install the necessary libraries:

Install Python libraries required for building the model.
bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
Import Libraries:

Import the necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
Load and Preprocess the Dataset:

Load an image dataset. Preprocess the images to feed into the model.
Define the CNN Model:

Define a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras.
Compile and Train the Model:

Compile the model and train it using training data.
Evaluate the Model:

Evaluate the model on the test data.
Visualize Results:

Visualize some predictions to ensure the model is working as expected.
